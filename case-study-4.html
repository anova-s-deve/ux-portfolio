		<h2 class="zero-margin-bott">What's the story? ðŸ“–</h2>
		<!--<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cartoon" src="images/Meet-Maria.png" alt="why redesign tunein?">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Why Redesign TuneIn? â€¢</figcaption>-->
		<!--<p class="text">One of the things that I realise I enjoy doing is writing and thinking through the work I have done. It helps me
			learn and reflect on what I did. So here goes my next journey. I've also taken 
			this opportunity to follow <a class="inline-links" href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud509">
				this Udacity course on Product Design</a> to chalk out this documention and taken the liberty to add what I could have done too.</p>-->
		<p class="text">Openhouse a.k.a, oh, before the pandemic, was a successful offline space for students of classes 6-12th to experience an alternate 
			learning style and build student communities after school hours. It aims to redefine how the world learns
			and empower students to become thinkers and leaders.</p>
		<p class="text">But when the pandemic hit, the vibrant offline space could no longer be where the teachers and kids convened for their classes and clubs. 
			The classes migrated online. And they soon realised that they could not facilitate the kind of classes they had or envisioned for their future on traditional video conferencing platforms. 
			That's when Openhouse decided to raise money and build an interactive video conferencing platform tailored towards their teacher and student communities.</p>


		<h2 class="zero-margin-bott">The Idea and Validation</h2>	

		<p class="text">Openhouse was a very interesting business to unpack and learn from.
			One of the first things I learnt is that it is a two sided market where parents and students make the demand side and teachers, the supply side. 
			The business works on an income sharing basis with teachers.
		</p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">The General Question</h3>

		<p class="verbatim"><b class="bold">How can we deliver a wholistic online learning  experience to students?</b></p>
		<p class="text">The 2 main assumptions in this general questions that need validation are:</p>

		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item">Rote learning hinders the capacity of a child to apply concepts to situations around them. Parents and students are looking for alternate learning styles.</li>
			<li class="list-item">Existing online platforms are unable to facilitate an engaging classroom experience.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 class="heading-two">User research and persona hypothesis</h2>

		<h3 class="heading-three">User interview: insert a questionnaire</h3>

		<p class="text">I was part of the product and design team entrusted to build an interactive video conferencing platform tailored towards the teacher and student 
			communities at oh. Although we were building for teachers and students, it was necessary to hear from all stakeholders about learning in schools and tuitions
			to make the case for an alternate learning philosophy and understand it. We were a bunch of fairly young people (20-35 year olds) in the team, had access to a about 
			50 students and their parents and a few teachers who were there with us from oh's offline learning days with them. We interviewed about 12 people and this
			is what we heard from them.
		</p>

		<p class="verbatim">"Rote learning to score well in exams doesnâ€™t allow for a deeper understanding of a subject."</p>

		<p class="verbatim">"Doesnâ€™t encourage the use of social skills. It is important that she grows up to be confident."</p>

		<p class="verbatim">"No connection between new and previous knowledge."</p>

		<p class="verbatim">"I would love for the class size to be smaller."</p>

		<p class="verbatim">"Even if I say I don't care about marks, we all know that I can't not care about it. It is how we get ahead in this brutal world.
			But it would be unfair to say that's all I care about. I want my child to grow up to a emotionally mature and sociable person as well and I wish their formal education
			contributed to that."</p>

		<p class="verbatim">"Memorization is not learning. When we train students to just memorize, we are not teaching them how to think or problem-solve."</p>

		<p class="verbatim">"Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. Rote memory has been found to be extremely effective in teaching basic math concepts. 
			Studies have shown that rote memory is perhaps the most effective way for primary students to learn counting, addition, subtraction, 
			and multiplication tables. Rote memory is also effective for learning basic vocabulary and spelling."</p>

		<p class="verbatim">"Opponents to rote memorization argue that creativity in students is stunted and suppressed, and students do not learn how to think, 
			analyze or solve problems. These educators believe, instead, that a more associative or constructive learning should be applied in the classroom."</p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Persona hypothesis</h3>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Enter "Active Learning"!</h3>

		<p class="text">Although, there are cases to be made for rote learning, there is no denying the fact that active learning if practised at scale could prove
			tremendously useful for children. Hence, it was concluded that it is worth investing in augmenting these after-school classrooms with meaningful active learning exercises.  
			Active learning focuses on teaching through projects and activities. 
			The pedagogy is implemented at scale with the help of "Experience Sets" that makes for oh's secret sauce!
			This is developed and curated by a team of expert educators that make up the Learning Design team at oh.

Is it a habit forming app? Does it have a trigger, action, variable reward, investment cycle to it?

		<p class="text">A parent interested in Openhouse signs up and receives a call from the sales team to understand requirements. The parent/ the student choose a slot for a trial class and attend the class.
			The sales team shares a classroom link and the student gets to attend the class. If they like the classes, they are enrolled with us for regular classes/ clubs.</p>

		<p class="text">A teacher either approaches or is approached by the supply team. The teachers attend a training session. This training is conducted by the Learning Design Team whose work makes Openhouse's 
			secret sauce if there was one. The Learning Deisgn Team prepares Experience Sets

End Goals: The heart of the userâ€™s interaction. This refers to the focus of a product and should be seen as the foundation of the userâ€™s goals.
Experience Goals: The emotional impact of a product. These are simple interactions that excite the user, and can range from appealing design and 
interactions to a general sort of â€˜whimsyâ€™ in its animations and copy. The experience should empower the user and make them feel like they are in control. 
Obtuse experiences that are overly complicated or unappealing can cause users to hate the product.
Life Goals: The userâ€™s personal aspiration. This refers to any of the userâ€™s goals beyond the scope of the application, typically success of some sort. 
Translating these goals into product design and brand strategy can dramatically increase the userâ€™s engagement with the product.

Â -> Spin the wheel animation
This is a protocol popularly known as spin-the-wheel and is used to make an unbiased selection most commonly of either students or themes in the context of a classroom learning environment.
Let's picturise the most intuitive user flow for this protocol.
> Spin the wheel animation

Imgine now plugging this in once the wheel tells you its selection. Plugging in the power to say "NO" once you're selected. Giving the student agency! I doubt if the students look at it that way. But the idea was to nurture certain mindsets and help them develop certain powerful social habits they will require. I loved that we had the opportunity to work on, test and understand these nuances. Regular feedback calls with teachers and students were extremely helpful.Â 
Another interesting feature was the babble meter.

Every product is about developing a habit.

Things to keep inÂ mind
Through this process what I think I need to keep in mind is that failure is not such a bad thing. Learning from my mistakes is more important than succeeding. So my learning if this is a failure, is something I have to include in this post. It will be important for me to approach this as an experiment.Â 
It is important to iterate and measure metrics.Â 
And talking to the users is important. Being skeptical of your idea and feeling the need to validate it is a virtue to be cherished.

My appraoch towards product building roughly always follows 
			the popular Design Thinking Framework by Roger Martin and IDEO's David Kelley and Tim Brown: Empathise > Define > Ideate > Prototype > Test > Implement and so on as required.
