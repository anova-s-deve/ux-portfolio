		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Why Redesign TuneIn? â€¢</figcaption>-->
		<!--<p class="text">One of the things that I realise I enjoy doing is writing and thinking through the work I have done. It helps me
			learn and reflect on what I did. So here goes my next journey. I've also taken 
			this opportunity to follow <a class="inline-links" href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud509">
				this Udacity course on Product Design</a> to chalk out this documention and taken the liberty to add what I could have done too.</p>-->
		<p class="text">Openhouse a.k.a. oh was an informal offline (until the pandemic) space for students to form clubs, attend workshops after school hours
			and for teachers to take tuitions. It aimed to redefine how the world learns
			and empower students to become thinkers and leaders.</p>

			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="ia-img" src="images/oh-pic1.png" alt="Openhouse physical space">
			</div>
			<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Openhouse offline space â€¢</figcaption>
			
		<p class="text">But when the pandemic hit, the vibrant offline space could no longer be where teachers and kids convened for classes and clubs. 
			The classes migrated online. And they soon realised that they could not facilitate the kind of classes they had envisioned for their future 
			on traditional video conferencing platforms.</p>
			
			<p class="text">I was part of a very tight "single designer - single product manager working very closely with the founder" team entrusted 
			to build an online learning space tailored towards teacher and student communities at oh for most of my time here.
			</p>

		<p class="text">Openhouse was a very interesting business to unpack and learn from.
			It was a two sided market where parents and students made the demand side and teachers, the supply side. 
			The business worked on an income sharing basis with teachers.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading-two">User research and persona hypothesis</h2>

		<p class="text">Openhouse was a young team passionate about education wanting to make a dent in the way our future generations learn.
		</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Assumption</h4>

		<p class="text"><b class="semi-bold">Rote learning hinders the capacity of a student to apply concepts to situations around them. Hence, parents and students 
			would invest in an alternate learning methodology.</b>
		</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Insights from user interviews</h4>

		<p class="text">Our first task was to understand our customers and users and get a sense of what their thoughts were about several aspects around their education. 
			We had access to about 
			50 students, their parents and a few teachers from oh's offline days. We interviewed 5 students, parents and teachers each to begin with. 
			The general question we tried answering was:
		</p>

		<p class="centralise-text"><b class="semi-bold">What makes learning experiences meaningful for students?</b></p>

		<p class="text">Linked here is<a class="inline-links" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15hSmdKNuKDhmQOWQsl0aoORDLswDZ5KCCSEi2Q0Yt4s/edit?usp=sharing">
			the semi-structured interview prepared for parents, students and teachers</a>. We knew we had to be thinking about executing whatever we came up with for online classes as well, so  
			the questions included their experience with online classes. 
			The goal of the interview was to understand who our users typically are and what they considered a meaningful learning experience. And what you see below is data 
	presented in a matrix by person and themes.</p>

	</div>
	<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Transcribing data points to sticky notes â€¢</figcaption>

			
		<p class="text">To identify themes in the data, we used Affinity mapping that helped us formulate our learning philosophy, <b class="bold">SHAPE 
			(Social, Holistic, Active, Personalised and Empowered)</b> :</p>
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">

			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Social</b>
			</li>

			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="shape" src="images/social.png" alt="Social">
			</div>
			<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Social â€¢</figcaption>

			<p class="text-bottom-border">This is a big one for after-school learning. Students have a choice in who their tutors are unlike schools.
				And they chose to learn from people who they believe are credible, even friendly if that's a choice. Nurturing every relationship and
				interaction they have in our space is important to us.
			</p>

			<p class="text-bottom-border">A decision that keeps with this learning philosophy that came easy was to maintain the tested and proven vibe at oh's offline space.
				This was a space students came to hang out with friends and attend variety workshops.
				Hence, the first steps were to simulate a similar social experience online.
			</p>

			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Holistic</b>
			</li>

			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="shape" src="images/holistic.png" alt="Holistic">
			</div>
			<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Holistic â€¢</figcaption>

			<p class="text-bottom-border"> We believe that the ultimate goal of learning is not just academic success, but overall development of the learner. We pay attention
				to the emotional and mental well being of the learner.
			</p>

			<p class="text-bottom-border">We took a very difficult decision to engage only with teachers that are friendly, empathetic, good facilitators, have a passion to learn new things/ 
				have hobbies, adapt and be enthusiastic about contributing to a new methodology of learning.
			</p>

			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Active</b>
			</li>

			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="shape" src="images/active.png" alt="Active">
			</div>
			<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Active â€¢</figcaption>

			<p class="text-bottom-border">People learn when they are ready to learn, not when we are ready to teach them. We want the learner to be cognitively and emotionally
				engaged through all of the learning experiences we facilitate for them.
			</p>

			<p class="text-bottom-border">We invested in experts from the field of education to develop new learning materials based on 'learning by doing' and train teachers on facilitation.
			</p>

			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Personlised</b>
			</li>

			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="shape" src="images/personalised.png" alt="Personalised">
			</div>
			<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Personalised â€¢</figcaption>

			<p class="text-bottom-border">Each of our learners have diverse skills, interests and needs. They have their own sense of identity and their beliefs are constantly evolving.
				Preserving them is important to us.
			</p>

			<p class="text-bottom-border">We decided to provide avenues for kids to express themselves, their evolving identities and meet like-minded individuals. Treating everybody with compassion to nurture
				each individual lies at the core of our beliefs. We also track the participation and progress of every student and provide custom feedback on each student towards achieving their individual goals.
			</p>

			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Empowering</b>
			</li>

			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="shape" src="images/empowered.png" alt="Empowered">
			</div>
			<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Empowered â€¢</figcaption>

			<p class="text-bottom-border"> We want the learner to take charge of their own learning and access doorways of opportunity. The purpose of learning 
				is to build capacity to pick up any knowledge relevant to this fast paced world.
			</p>

			<p class="text-bottom-border">We aim to connect students with a compassionate and talented community of peers and facilitators. Openhouse also organises workshops and has clubs 
				that encourage students to go beyond academics and excel in anything that they desire. 
			</p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Enter Active learning and 'Experience sets'!</h3>

		<p class="text">Active learning focuses on teaching through projects and activities. After-school learning programs/ tuitions are common in India among students from grade 8th through 12th. 
			Many complex foundational concepts that are not explored through projects and activities also lie in those grades. Hence, Openhouse decided to initiate a project  
			to design "Experience Sets" based on the philosophy of Active Learning to facilitate lessons and concepts 
			covered in the CBSE, ICSE and IB syllabi for these grades. A team of academicians that made up the Learning Design team was assigned this task.
		</p>

		<p class="text">A quick brainstorming session was conducted with an extended team that aimed to deconstruct some of our memorable learning experiences, inside and outside of schools.
			We identified that every memorable learning experience we shared started off with feeling curious followed by some experimentation/ exploration and ended with some form of reflection.
			Our Learning Design Team attempted to do just that with an 'Experience set'.A few Experience sets were designed for different subjects and we tested them out in a couple of live classes.
		</p>


		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="romap" src="images/experience-sets.png" alt="User journey of an Experience Set">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ User journey of an Experience Set â€¢</figcaption>

		<p class="text">In a class of 6-8 students online, we found that the experience sets really engaged students. The user feedback on it was very promising when compared 
			to how the same lesson would have been facilitated traditionally. Although the scalability of it was a concern, the Learning Design team decided it was worth the effort. 
			The team incorporated existing learning protocols like quizzes, jeopardy, spin the wheel, memory palace etc. and continued to work on these Experience Sets.</p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Next, Oh meets- the learning space</h3>

		<p class="centralise-text"><b class="semi-bold">"Even if the pandemic goes away, this can happen again and online classes are definitely going to be part of the contigency plans from now on. 
			
			I think institutions would be gearing up to seamlessly transition to online classes in case of these situations again."</b></p>

		<p class="text">The above reflection by a teacher justifies any effort taken in the direction of making online classrooms better.
		</p>

		<p class="text">This project involved creating a delightful online learning space for oh student and teacher communities.
			After brainstorming and moodboarding a couple of metaphors for the learning space, we came up with the oh lobby for discovery of services
			that were to be offered.</p>

		<div class="full-width">
		<iframe class="figma" width="55%" height="900" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FEls56UQJlCJ9nNIMYzJWFI%2FflightBuddyEmbed%3Fkind%3D%26node-id%3D49%253A3754%26scaling%3Dscale-down" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		</div>

		<p class="text">I worked on the design for the lobby.</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Synchronous online classes</h4>
		
		<p class="text">We then focused on the video conferencing platforms where synchronous learning takes place. All of the teachers we interviewed used either Zoom or Google Meets.
			We shadowed classes on Zoom and Google Meets at oh and conducted focus groups with teachers and students. The objective was to identify their pain points conducting and attending
			online classes. We looked at several interactions/ user tasks in a class from online and offline classes and create a priority list. We also found a very interesting competitor
			called 'Class for Zoom' that was trying to solve some critical problems for online synchronous classes.

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="ia-img" src="images/wireframes-oh.png" alt="Empowered">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Brainstorming features â€¢</figcaption>

		<p class="text">I worked with the project manager on creating the feature list and brainstorming the possibilities.
			I had the chance to contribute towards the design of the platform as we see in the designs below and a few other fun features- Student engagement, 
			Peer to peer interactions and Non-verbal feedback. Other feature were detailed out by fellow designers.
		</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Student engagement features</h4>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="ia-img" src="images/elsewhere.png" alt="Elsewhere">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ <b class="bold">Elsewhere-</b> When a student moves to another tab on their browser, their video tile becomes black and white and says 'Elsewhere'. 
			This wasn't a widely popular idea among students but with a close knit and friendly class like at Openhouse, it was introduced not to penalise students but 
			in the hopes that it might become a topic for lighter moments in class and in turn keep students engaged in class. â€¢
		</figcaption>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="ia-img" src="images/participant-list.png" alt="Partcipant list">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ <b class="bold">Participant list-</b> The teacher can get a succint picture of everything happening realtime in a neatly ordered list, 
			apply filters to the list and take actions if required. This becomes especially useful for when there are more than 6 students in class as that's the max 
			the screen can show at a time. â€¢
		</figcaption>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="ia-img" src="images/babble-meter.png" alt="Babble meter">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ <b class="bold">Babble meter-</b> We identified that it is diffcult to facilitate and at the same time pay attention to each student while on a call.
			To help with this we give teachers, in realtime, an idea of how much each student has been speaking 
			and direct the teacher's attention to prompt those who may not be speaking much or at all. â€¢
		</figcaption>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Peer to peer interactions</h4>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="ia-img" src="images/tomato.png" alt="Greetings with a tomato">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ <b class="bold">Greetings with a tomato-</b> We wanted to incentivise those who come to class with their videos on by giving them access 
			to this feature. This feature
			lets the teacher and students throw as many tomatoes as they'd like on others on the call. The prompts into the class are 'Throw tomatoes' and 'Not in mood'. 
			Not in mood lets them enter class with their videos off and they will be unable to throw tomatoes on anybody for the duration of the class. 
			It serves as a mood check for when a student enters the class and also serves to set the tone for any of our classes. This feature did show a dip in performace 
			amongst oh meets users who used the platform for 6 months and more. â€¢
		</figcaption>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="ia-img" src="images/vibing.png" alt="Vibing">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ <b class="bold">Vibing-</b> This is the millenial version of the '+1' reaction on platforms like slack. When a person "vibes" with 
			another person in class, we see a neon vibing sign and glow on them simultaneously. â€¢
		</figcaption>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="ia-img" src="images/GIF.png" alt="GIF">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ <b class="bold">GIF-</b> The video tile of a person changes to the GIF they posted on the chat. â€¢
		</figcaption>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Non-verbal feedback</h4>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="ia-img" src="images/Non-verbal-feedback.png" alt="Non-verbal feedback">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ <b class="bold">Non-verbal feedback-</b> We built 4 reactions keeping to the Oh tone including a hand-raise 
			to cover a good number of situations in class. The handraise is persistant and remains until the teacher/ the student themselves put it down. The other reactions
			last for 10 seconds like on Zoom. â€¢
		</figcaption>

	
		<p class="text">What we tried to do with most interactions is to make them happen right where the classes are. The intention was to avoid potentially distracting threads 
			that can go on in the chatbox or elsewhere. This was also done to establish the tone that we aspire to for classes at Openhouse.
		</p>

		<p class="text">Since we were a growing startup, we used user testing to get feedback and keep tabs on the performance of oh meets. However, we noticed churn quite early after
			the release
