		<!--<p class="text">One of the things that I realise I enjoy doing is writing and thinking through the work I have done. It helps me
			learn and reflect on what I did. So here goes my next journey. I've also taken 
			this opportunity to follow <a class="inline-links" href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud509">
				this Udacity course on Product Design</a> to chalk out this documention and taken the liberty to add what I could have done too.</p>-->
		<p class="text">Openhouse a.k.a, oh, before the pandemic, was a successful offline space for students of classes 6-12th to experience an alternate 
			learning style and build student communities after school hours. It aims to redefine how the world learns
			and empower students to become thinkers and leaders.</p>
		<p class="text">But when the pandemic hit, the vibrant offline space could no longer be where the teachers and kids convened for their classes and clubs. 
			The classes migrated online. And they soon realised that they could not facilitate the kind of classes they had or envisioned for their future on traditional video conferencing platforms. 
			That's when Openhouse decided to raise money and build an interactive video conferencing platform tailored towards their teacher and student communities.</p>

		<h2 class="zero-margin-bott">The Idea and Validation</h2>	

		<p class="text">Openhouse was a very interesting business to unpack and learn from.
			One of the first things I learnt is that it is a two sided market where parents and students make the demand side and teachers, the supply side. 
			The business works on an income sharing basis with teachers.
		</p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">The hypothesis</h3>

		<p class="text">Rote learning hinders the capacity of a child to apply concepts to situations around them. Parents are looking for alternate learning styles.</p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Validating the hypothesis</h3>

		<p class="text">In early 2021, we surveyed 230+ parents to identify what they felt about their child's education. And we found that,

		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ UX Roadmap â€¢</figcaption>

		Parents want all-round developemnt, not just academic learning. Parents are looking for a new style of learning.

		<h3 class="heading-three">Enter "Active Learning"!</h3>

		<p class="text">Active learning focuses on teaching through projects and activities. 
			The pedagogy is implemented at scale with the help of "Experience Sets" that makes for oh's secret sauce!
			This is developed and curated by a team of expert educators that make up the Learning Design team at oh.

Is it a habit forming app? Does it have a trigger, action, variable reward, investment cycle to it?

		<p class="text">A parent interested in Openhouse signs up and receives a call from the sales team to understand requirements. The parent/ the student choose a slot for a trial class and attend the class.
			The sales team shares a classroom link and the student gets to attend the class. If they like the classes, they are enrolled with us for regular classes/ clubs.</p>

		<p class="text">A teacher either approaches or is approached by the supply team. The teachers attend a training session. This training is conducted by the Learning Design Team whose work makes Openhouse's 
			secret sauce if there was one. The Learning Deisgn Team prepares Experience Sets
		</p> -->

		<h2 class="heading-two">User research and persona hypothesis</h2>

		<p class="text">I was part of the product and design team entrusted to build an interactive video conferencing platform tailored towards the teacher and student communities at oh.
			Although parents are our customers, they aren't the users of the 
			video conferencing platform. Hence the user research for product development focused on the student and teacher personas.

		<h3 class="heading-three">Persona hypothesis</h3>

		Teacher personas
		1. 23-27 yr olds, Bachelors, who listens to us, 1 yr teaching experience
		2. 26-32 yr olds, masters, 2 yr ofteching experience, 2 yrs of corporate experience

End Goals: The heart of the userâ€™s interaction. This refers to the focus of a product and should be seen as the foundation of the userâ€™s goals.
Experience Goals: The emotional impact of a product. These are simple interactions that excite the user, and can range from appealing design and 
interactions to a general sort of â€˜whimsyâ€™ in its animations and copy. The experience should empower the user and make them feel like they are in control. 
Obtuse experiences that are overly complicated or unappealing can cause users to hate the product.
Life Goals: The userâ€™s personal aspiration. This refers to any of the userâ€™s goals beyond the scope of the application, typically success of some sort. 
Translating these goals into product design and brand strategy can dramatically increase the userâ€™s engagement with the product.

Â -> Spin the wheel animation
This is a protocol popularly known as spin-the-wheel and is used to make an unbiased selection most commonly of either students or themes in the context of a classroom learning environment.
Let's picturise the most intuitive user flow for this protocol.
> Spin the wheel animation

Imgine now plugging this in once the wheel tells you its selection. Plugging in the power to say "NO" once you're selected. Giving the student agency! I doubt if the students look at it that way. But the idea was to nurture certain mindsets and help them develop certain powerful social habits they will require. I loved that we had the opportunity to work on, test and understand these nuances. Regular feedback calls with teachers and students were extremely helpful.Â 
Another interesting feature was the babble meter.

Every product is about developing a habit.

Things to keep inÂ mind
Through this process what I think I need to keep in mind is that failure is not such a bad thing. Learning from my mistakes is more important than succeeding. So my learning if this is a failure, is something I have to include in this post. It will be important for me to approach this as an experiment.Â 
It is important to iterate and measure metrics.Â 
And talking to the users is important. Being skeptical of your idea and feeling the need to validate it is a virtue to be cherished.

		<h4 class="heading-four">Competitive audit</h4>
		<p class="text">TuneIn's business goal is steered to streaming live radio from world over on the internet on one dial
		and further solving for discovery.</p>			
		<p class="text">Since music streaming and the new "radio" (automated playlists) are impacting the market share for
		Live Radio, it makes it all the more crucial to observe and analyse the competitor music streaming services as well.</p>
		<p class="text">Popular competitors to TuneIn as listed by web analytics service,<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.similarweb.com/">

		</ol>
		<p class="text">Five individuals from the aforementioned user base participated

		<p class="text">The interview also comprised of the users discussing their real/ hypothetic motivations to use the App, how they
		would go about the usage and what their pain points are. We looked at a page-wise critique of the application
		generally comprising of its homepage, category page and the final product page.</p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Making sense of it all aka Problem Definition</h3>



		<h4 class="heading-four">"Is this Live Radio?"</h4>
		<p class="text">The formative research on TuneIn exposed the tough competition that Radio faces from other
			types of content in video and written formats on the internet. Hence, introducing potential users like Maria
			to "Live Radio" and "Podcasts" also becomes an important function.  
		</p>
		<p class="text">For example, the homepage adorns the tagline below leading to a bad usability experience for "Exploratory seekers" 
			like Maria.</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four-top">Information Architecture (IA)</h4>		

		<h5 class="heading-five">1. Taxonomy</h5>
		<p class="text">By shifting from its present system of organisation that appears to be a restrictive hierarchichal taxonomy,

		<h5 class="heading-five">3. Navigation</h5>
		<p class="text">The current interface for 
		TuneIn has a strict hierarchical taxonomy under the four main categories of content- Music, Talk, Shows and 
		Sports. Hence, options for navigation are it's name-sake. However, user research indicates 
		users preferring modern modes of Discovery- from algorithms, curators, etc.
		Enabled by the restructured taxonomy, a recommender system learning from the set preferences and historical data of users
		shall facilitate a better navigation :</p>

		Cognitive walkthroughs with 5 users and a product designer with the help of 
		low-medium fidelity prototypes were used for user testing.</p>



		<h4 class="heading-four-top">Concept Sketches</h4>
		<p class="text">Hand-drawn user flows were used for early discussions with fellow designers. A separate Landing Page for TuneIn
		was ommited in the user flow as the user research was not in support of it. Instead, an onboarding flow was voted up 
		as an efficient way to ease into the application and populate the home page for a first time user.</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">High Fidelity Prototypes, Testing and Iteration</h4>
		<p class="text">I used Figma to create the prototypes. The goal is to move towards a solution for all 9 of the features 
		identified during feature prioritisation. Usability tests were conducted with high fidelity prototypes to arrive
	  	at the prototypes discussed below.</p>

		<h5 class="heading-five">Exploratory Seeking</h5>
		<p class="text">This prototype 
		serves Maria to edit her profile settings in order to update her 
		preferences. It also addresses the problem specifically mentioned in Scenario-2, Heuristic Walkthrough
		(Maria wants to listen to music by Amy Winehouse) delivering the search results with integrity.<a class="inline-links"

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="c-image" src="images/mockup-1.png" alt="mockup-1">
		</div>
		<h5 class="heading-five">Refinding</h5>
		<p class="text">Refinding allows Shyam to access a well organised favourited item. 
		The favourited item in consideration is notified to Shyam with an alert. The feature to search for a 
		specific episode within a podcast and arrange the episodes in ascending or descending order is also incorporated.
		<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SRxzMGtbafN8TIA38Ir35a/tune-in-FINAL?node-id=210%3A8894&viewport=627%2C382%2C0.10140478610992432&scaling=scale-down">

			<img class="c-image" src="images/mockup-2.png" alt="mockup-2">
		</div>		
		<h5 class="heading-five">Known-item seeking</h5>
		<p class="text">The last prototype demonstrates Shyam signing up to TuneIn with an option to 
		indicate his preferences. The flow also shows Shyam searching for the station "Pravasi Bharathi" to add to his library to find later.
		<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SRxzMGtbafN8TIA38Ir35a/tune-in-FINAL?node-id=83%3A3714&viewport=85%2C343%2C0.06618700921535492&scaling=scale-down">

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="c-image" src="images/mockup-3.png" alt="mockup-3">
		</div>
		<p class="text">The feature to pose users as content curators and subsequently introducing more socialisation 
		to TuneIn remains unchartered in this study. Further iterations could include conceptualisation, testing and refinement 
		of this feature.</p>
		


		<h3 class="heading-three">Takeaways</h3>	
		<ol class="num-list-take" type="1">
			<li class="list-item-takeaway"><b class="bold-miriam">Live Radio under Threat :</b> Although news articles released on the likes of the "World Radio Day" may 
				argue otherwise, Radio as a medium is under threat and can only survive amongst the youth via the internet.
				Hence, studying the real-world context surrounding it gives us an insight into such
				applications' larger role. In this case, educating people about the jargon around radio, 
				identifying its utility for specific events such as local/ national disasters and 
				designing to incorporate such affordances can play a pivotal role in preserving it's relevance.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item-takeaway"><b class="bold-miriam">The Experience of Search and Discovery :</b> Although building algorithms is 
				rightfully the developer's role, designers informed and involved with 
				Search, Music Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Algorithms will prove a godsend to any team. According to my research, 
				features such as real-time content suggestions and weighted properties like 
				the occurence of an item being favourited, the number of streams, 
				the date and location seemed appropriate for retrieval. A combined content-based and collaborative filtering method 
				is the preffered choice of recommender system for its versatality.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item-takeaway-last"><b class="bold-miriam">At crossroads? Look to your user! :</b> I am swept away by the influence 
				user/ stakeholder interactions have towards design resolution each time. These contributions must never be overlooked. 
				That said, the opportunity to organise and conduct a successful Charrette would be a dream!
			</li>
