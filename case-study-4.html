		<h2 class="zero-margin-bott">What's the story? ðŸ“–</h2>
		<!--<div class="full-width">
			<img class="cartoon" src="images/Meet-Maria.png" alt="why redesign tunein?">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Why Redesign TuneIn? â€¢</figcaption>-->
		<!--<p class="text">One of the things that I realise I enjoy doing is writing and thinking through the work I have done. It helps me
			learn and reflect on what I did. So here goes my next journey. I've also taken 
			this opportunity to follow <a class="inline-links" href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud509">
				this Udacity course on Product Design</a> to chalk out this documention and taken the liberty to add what I could have done too.</p>-->
		<p class="text">Openhouse a.k.a, oh, before the pandemic, was a successful offline space for students of classes 6-12th to experience an alternate 
			learning style and build student communities after school hours. It aims to redefine how the world learns
			and empower students to become thinkers and leaders.</p>

			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="ia-img" src="images/oh-pic1.png" alt="Openhouse physical space">
			</div>
			<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Openhouse offline space â€¢</figcaption>
			
		<p class="text">But when the pandemic hit, the vibrant offline space could no longer be where teachers and kids convened for classes and clubs. 
			The classes migrated online. And they soon realised that they could not facilitate the kind of classes they had or envisioned for their future on traditional video conferencing platforms. 
			</p>


		<h2 class="zero-margin-bott">The Idea and Validation</h2>	

		<p class="text">Openhouse was a very interesting business to unpack and learn from.
			One of the first things I learnt is that it is a two sided market where parents and students make the demand side and teachers, the supply side. 
			The business works on an income sharing basis with teachers. I was part of the new design and product team entrusted 
			to build an online learning space tailored towards the teacher and student 
			communities at oh.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading-two">User research and persona hypothesis</h2>

		<p class="text">Our first task was to understand our users. We had access to about 
			50 students, their parents and a few teachers from oh's offline days. We interviewed about 5 students, parents and teachers each to begin with. 
			The general question we tried answering was:
		</p>

		<p class="centralise-text"><b class="semi-bold">What makes learning experiences meaningful for students?</b></p>
		<p class="text">Our assumption was that rote learning hinders the capacity of a student to apply concepts to situations around them. Hence, parents and students 
			would invest in meaningful and active learning experiences.</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Insights from user interviews</h4>

		<p class="text">Linked here is<a class="inline-links" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15hSmdKNuKDhmQOWQsl0aoORDLswDZ5KCCSEi2Q0Yt4s/edit?usp=sharing">
			the semi-structured interview prepared for parents, students and teachers</a>. 
			The goal of the interview was to understand who our users typically are and what they considered a meaningful learning experience. And what you see below is data 
	presented in a matrix by person and themes.</p>

		<p class="text">Answering this question lead to us to formulating our learning philosophy that drove further decisions, <b class="bold">SHAPE</b> :</p>
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Social:</b> This is a big one for after-school learning. Students have a choice in who their tutors are unlike schools.
				And they chose to learn from people who they believe are credible and knowledgeable, even friendly if that's a choice. Nurturing every relationship and
				interaction they have in our space is important to us.</li>
				<div class="full-width">
					<img class="shape" src="images/social.png" alt="Social">
				</div>
				<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Social â€¢</figcaption>

				<p class="text-bottom-border">A decision that keeps with this learning philosophy that came easy was to maintain the tested and proven vibe at oh's offline space.
					This was a space students came to hang out with friends, attend variety workshops and teachers also came in to conduct their tuitions.
					Hence, the first steps were to simulate a similar social experience online.</p>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Holistic:</b> We believe that the ultimate goal of learning is not just academic success, but overall development of the learner. We pay attention
				to the emotional and mental well being of the learner.</li>

				<div class="full-width">
					<img class="shape" src="images/holistic.png" alt="Holistic">
				</div>
				<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Holistic â€¢</figcaption>

				<p class="text-bottom-border">We took a very difficult decision to engage only with teachers that are friendly, empathetic, good facilitators, have a passion to learn new things/ 
					have hobbies, adapt and be enthusiastic about contributing to a new methodology of learning.</p>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Active:</b> People learn when they are ready to learn, not when we are ready to teach them. We want the learner to be cognitively and emotionally
				engaged through all of the learning experiences we facilitate for them.
			</li>

			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="shape" src="images/active.png" alt="Active">
			</div>
			<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Active â€¢</figcaption>

				<p class="text-bottom-border">We invested in experts from the field of education to develop new learning materials based on 'learning by doing' and train teachers on facilitation.</p>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Personlised:</b> Each of our learners have diverse skills, interests and needs. They have their own sense of identity and their beliefs are constantly evolving.
				Preserving them is important to us.</li>

				<div class="full-width">
					<img class="shape" src="images/personalised.png" alt="Personalised">
				</div>
				<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Personalised â€¢</figcaption>

				<p class="text-bottom-border">We decided to provide avenues for kids to express themselves, their evolving identities and meet like-minded individuals. Treating everybody with compassion to nurture
					each individual lies at the core of our beliefs. We also track the participation and progress of every student and provide custom feedback on each student towards achieving their individual goals.</p>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Empowering:</b> We want the learner to take charge of their own learning and access doorways of opportunity. The purpose of learning 
			is to build capacity to pick up any knowledge relevant to this fast paced world.</li>

			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="shape" src="images/empowered.png" alt="Empowered">
			</div>
			<figcaption class="fig-tit">â€¢ Data points for Empowered â€¢</figcaption>

				<p class="text-bottom-border">We aim to connect students with a compassionate and talented community of peers and facilitators. Openhouse also organises workshops and has clubs 
					that encourage students to go beyond academics and excel in anything that they desire. 
				</p>
		</ol>

		<p class="text">This learning philosophy spurred multiple projects and modules for the business handled by different teams. I had the opportunity to be part of 2 of these projects:</p>
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item">Redesigning learning materials</li>
			<li class="list-item">Creating a delightful online learning space</li>
		</ol>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Persona hypothesis</h4>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Enter Active learning and Experience sets!</h3>

		<p class="text">Active learning focuses on teaching through projects and activities. After-school learning programs/ tuitions are common in India among students from grade 8th through 12th. 
			Many complex foundational concepts that are not explored through projects and activities also lie in those grades. Hence, Openhouse decided to initiate a project  
			to design "Experience Sets" based on the philosophy of Active Learning to facilitate lessons and concepts 
			covered in the CBSE, ICSE and IB syllabi for these grades. A team of academicians that made up the Learning Design team was assigned this task.
		</p>

		<p class="text">An experience set is designed to give opportunities to experiment, make mistakes, contemplate and apply their learning.
		</p>

		<h3 class="heading-three">Next, the learning space</h3>

		<p class="centralise-text"><b class="semi-bold">"Even if the pandemic goes away, this can happen again and online classes are definitely going to be part of the contigency plans from now on. 

			School for teachers is never going to be same again. We have to learn many new ways of doing things now and we have to adapt.
			
			I think institutions would be gearing up to seamlessly transition to online classes in case of these situations again."</b></p>

		<p class="text">This reflection by a teacher summarises and justifies any effort taken in the direction of making online classrooms better.
			Another decision that keeps with our learning philosophy that came easy was to maintain the tested and proven vibe at oh's offline space.
			This was a space students felt stimulated or just came to hang out with friends, attend variety workshops and teachers came in to conduct their tuitions.
			Hence, the first step was to simulate a similar exploratory experience online and address issues faced by teachers and students in online environments.</p>

		<p class="text">After brainstorming and moodboarding a couple of metaphors for the learning space, we came up with the oh lobby for discovery of services
			that were to be offered.</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">User pain points about online classes</h4>
		
		<p class="text">We approached studying the pain points and opportunities offered by online classes by conducting focus groups with teachers and students.
			We also shadowed classes on zoom and Google Meets for existing classes. There is a lot of information about students that teachers have access to by virtue of being present with them physically which they don't online. 
			We noticed it was necessary to gather as many data points of the pulse of a class and get as much feedback as possible to determine the health of a classroom. 
			We looked at recordings of current zoom and Google Meets classes, shadowed classes as TAs and ........</p>
