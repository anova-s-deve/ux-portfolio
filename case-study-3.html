		<p class="text"><b class="bold">About 98 million people live in distressing sanitary conditions 
			across urban slums in India.</b> The lack of household toilets pose not just health risks but 
			also safety risks to women and other vulnerable demographics like the disabled, the elderly and the ill. 
			There have been countless reported cases of women and those vulnerable being harassed
			on their way to community toilets or while defecating in the open, away from their homes, especially post sundown. The 
			problem of sanitation in urban slums has plagued generations of urban planners. There is no universal model 
			that works across cultures to solve this problem. Here we introduce you to one that seems to be gaining 
			momentum in the state of Maharashtra through years of patient research, experimentation and evolution.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading-two">Introducing the OHOT Model</h2>
		<p class="text">Recognizing the problems posed by open defecation as well as community toilets that have their own 
			set of disadvantages; <b class="bold">Shelter Associates (SA)</b>, a Pune based grassroots level non-profit has over the years
			perfected a safe and affordable solution to the sanitation problem that focuses on facilitating individual 
			household toilets through its data driven, replicable, scalable and multi-stakeholder inclusive <b class="bold">‚ÄòOne Home One Toilet‚Äô (OHOT) model</b>
			. The Initiative was awarded <b class="bold">The Local Project Challenge Honor Award 2020 at 
				The World Urban Forum by the UN Habitat</b>.</p> 
		<p class="text"><a class="inline-links" href="http://shelter-associates.org/support.php">The model 
			involves construction materials facilitated by our donors being delivered at the beneficiaries'
			doorstep free of cost. The beneficiaries then contribute towards the construction of the 
			toilet instilling a sense of ownership.</a></p>
	
		<h2 class="heading-two">My Role</h2>
		<p class="text">My engagement with SA was piqued by my interest in mapping informal
			human settlements. I worked in the capacity of a designer redesigning 
			operational dashbords and in the process also worked on some very interesting and niche spatial data 
			management and visualisation.</p>
		 
		<h2 class="heading-two">User Research</h2>
		<h4 class="heading-four">Workflow</h4>
		<p class="text">SA has been involved in mapping settlement patterns and infrastructure in and around slums across Pune,
			Kolhapur, Sangli, Pimpri Chinchwad and recently Navi Mumbai partnering with local
			government bodies to deliver sanitation infrastructure to individual households in slums. The workflow is as follows:</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Problems identified</h4>
		<p class="text">On conducting usability tests of the existing user flows with the Executive Director, M&E Manager, Project Manager and GIS 
			analysts, these broad problems were identified:
		</p>
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Inconsistent raw data : </b>Lack of a consistent methodology in questionnaires used 
				over time rendered 20 years' worth of data on sanitation of informal
				settlements across these 5 districts in different formats, unfit for integration and analysis.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Varying map design : </b>Maps made by different analysts followed different 
				cartographic styles due to the lack of a 
				cartographic style guide. An outdated proprietary GIS software, also lacking in creating map templates, 
				was hindering the team's scalability due to limited 
				number of licenses.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Dashboards without insights : </b>The dashboard designed 
				did not provide any insights from the data collected by SA. The dashboard was 
				not designed for any user in specific and hence was not the user's first choice for insights. 
			</li>

			
		</ol>
		 
		<h2 class="heading-two">Red Routes</h2>
		<p class="text">Based on the problems identified and requirements collected from the users, the following red routes
			were proposed:
		</p>

		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Survey form redesign and data migration</b></li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Cartographic style guide and themes</b></li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Dashboard redesign</b></li>

		</ol>

		<h3 class="heading-three">1. Survey form redesign and Data migration</h3>
		<p class="text">We switched to an open-source web-based application called 
			<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo Toolbox</a> for defining and deploying survey forms 
			and it's android app which also works offline for data collection. Existing raw data was evaluated and cleaned. 
			Surveys were redesigned to incorporate 
			<a class="inline-links" href="https://docs.getodk.org/form-logic/">form logic</a> that includes
			validating and restricting responses and types, conditional questions, setting defaults and cascading lists.</p>
		<p class="text">The data collection was segregated into  
			the following surveys:</p>

		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Rapid Infrastructure Mapping</b> ‚Äì mapping of existing infrastructure of slum</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Rapid Household Surveys</b> ‚Äì collecting household level data</li>
			<li class="list-item"><b class="bold">Individual factsheet</b> ‚Äì for maintaining record of completed toilets</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="text">The process involved charting elaborate decision trees for each of the surveys and 
			defining them on Kobo Form Builder as per the logic developed with user research. Click on the 
			image below to view the decision tree prepared for the Rapid Household Survey.
		</p>

			<img class="romap-link" src="images/decisionTree.png" alt="ux-roadmap">
		</a>

		<p class="text">All the existing data in multiple formats was migrated to the newly created forms.
			This migrated data then fed into the dashboards designed for different users.</p>





















			<h3 class="heading-three">2. Cartographic style guides and themes</h3>
			<p class="text">Based on usability studies of existing maps with GIS Analysts, the M&E manager and the Executive Director 
				interacting with maps in ways ranging from its preparation to presentations, it was observed that 
				developing a cartographic style guide and correcting the use of colour across maps was required. 
			</p>
	
			<p class="text"><b class="bold">25 thematic maps</b> were shortlisted to be prepared
				by Tanaji The GIS analyst. Using design best practices, the maps were categorised into 3 colour schemes for 
				spatial data visualisation.  
				<b class="bold">The basic principle for the colour schemes is that variations in 
					hue denote nominal/categorical differences while 
				variations in lightness show ordinal differences.</b>
			</p>
	
			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="hsl" src="images/hsl.png" alt="ux-roadmap">
			</div>
	
			<p class="text">We take the example of thematic maps of Kalakhadak in Kolhapur to demonstrate
				the visualisation style guide.
			</p>
	
			<ol class="num-list" type="1">
				<li class="list-item-color-schemes"><b class="bold">Qualitative scheme</b></li>
				<p class="text">Nominal data like the 'Type of structure occupancy', 'Ownership status of 
					the house', 'Type of water connection', 'Facility of household solid waste collection', 
					'Current place of defecation', 'Type of toilet preferrred' etc. use 
					a qualitative color scheme to illuminate each of the themes and spatial patterns if any.
				</p>
	
				<p class="text">This is a map that shows the type of structure occupancy in Kalakhadak, Kolhapur. This map 
					<b class="bold">uses 
						variations in hue to highlight each nominal category</b> to the user.
				</p>
				<div class="full-width">
					<img class="cs-image" src="images/qual.png" alt="ux-roadmap">
				</div>
		
				<li class="list-item-color-schemes"><b class="bold">Sequential scheme</b></li>
				<p class="text">Ordinal data such as 'Type of structure of the house', 'House area in sq.ft.', 
					'Proximity to sewage connection' are represented best by sequential color schemes.
				</p>
	
				<p class="text">The map below shows the house 
					area in sq.ft. across Kalakhadak. It <b class="bold">uses 
						gradations in lightness to convey the ordinal differences</b> in the size of tenements in the settlement.
				</p>
	
				<div class="full-width">
					<img class="cs-image" src="images/sequential.png" alt="ux-roadmap">
				</div>
	
				<li class="list-item-color-schemes"><b class="bold">Binary scheme</b></li>
				<p class="text">Nominal differences with two opposing data points like a yes or no survey question
					served as the sample of binary color schemes. Data representing whether a 'household was or wasn't 
					interested in having a household toilet built', the 'ownership status of the occupants' etc. are examples for this scheme.
					
				</p>
	
				<p class="text">The map below shows the data for whether or not the household is interested in building a toilet. 
					This map <b class="bold">uses two contrasting hues to depict binary data</b> .
				</p>
				<div class="full-width">
					<img class="cs-image" src="images/yesno.png" alt="ux-roadmap">
				</div>
			</ol>
	
			<p class="text-top">The map design 
				was decided in consultation with the team based on their requirements. The map and data templates for the preparation
				of all 25 thematic maps was created on an open source GIS software called 
				<a class="inline-links" href="https://qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>.
			</p>

			<p class="text"><b class="bold">This exercise made the maps 
				prepared by Shelter unique and the process of preparation of the maps much easier and faster than before.
					It also contributed to the maps conveying necessary information clearly.

		<h3 class="heading-three">3. Dashboard redesign</h3>

		<p class="text">This redesign project consists of 3 dashboards for Lata The Executive Director, Smita The M&E Manager and
			Dhanasree The Project Manager respectively. 
			The dashboards are a part of the 'Shelter App', a platform for managing and maintaining
			the data collected by Shelter Associates. Sanitation and hygiene related data
			is of much value to various institutions for research and developmental activities. 
			In addition to this data, there is also a generous amount of operational 
			data that must be converted into insights for team managers.
		</p>

		<h4 class="heading-four">Goals for the dashboard</h4>
		<ol class="num-list" type="1">
			
			<li class="list-item">Prime real estate on the dashboard must be dedicated to opeartional metrics. 
			</li>
			<li class="list-item">The dashboard must answer frequently asked questions at a glance.</li>
			<li class="list-item">The dashboard must focus on personalisation for each user over the ability
				to customise.
			</li>		

		</ol>

		<h4 class="heading-four">i. Dashboard for Lata The Executive Director</h4>

		<p class="text">The dashboards tab consists of 3 sub-tabs- 'Toilet construction', 'Community mobilisation'
			and 'RHS and Follow-up'. In this case study, we will be looking at the 'Toilet construction' dashboard. 
		</p>

		<p class="text">There are 3 levels of filters to the dashboard to view insights- 'All', 'City level', 'Slum level'. 
			Lata has access to information at every level. However, her default view would be
			personalised at the level 'All'.
		</p>

		<p class="text">The card titled 'Budget exhausted vs. Toilets constructed' highlighed the budget in red when it crossed
			a threshold of an excess of 5% in spending than the toilets completed. This was a threshold identified by the CEO and 
			M&E Manager for raising an alarm to take action.
		</p>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class='style-dashboard' src="images/ExecDir.png" alt="mockup-3">
		</div>

		<h4 class="heading-four">ii. Dashboard for Smita The M&E Manager</h4>

		<p class="text">
			Smita also has access to information at every level. However, her default view would be
			personalised at the level of any one of the cities where the work is ongoing. She also has access to insights
			at the level 'All' but does not see the operational cards at that level.
		</p>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class='style-dashboard' src="images/M&E.png" alt="mockup-3">
		</div>

		<h4 class="heading-four">iii. Dashboard for Dhanasree The Project Manager</h4>

		<p class="text"> 
			Dhanasree's access is restricted to the city assigned to her, for example, Navi Mumbai and
			the slums within the city. Her default view is at the level of any one of the slums where the work is ongoing.
		</p>

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class='style-dashboard' src="images/ProjectManager.png" alt="mockup-3">
		</div>

		<p class="text"><b class="bold"> 
			Donor management using the dashboard enabled timely communication and 
			resulted in better relationship with donors. The metrics identified also enabled management of funds and identification 
			of excess spending. Overall, it resulted in reduced stress, increased visibility 
			and proved to be a tremendous time saver for its users.</b></p>






		

















		<h2 class="heading-two">Inspiration from this experience</h2>
		<p class="text">During the research for spatial data visualisation work,
			I came across a very interesting project called <a class="inline-links" href="https://morphocode.com/">Morphocode</a>.
			It is a design and development project on mapping urban data along with related services and contains tutorials on the same.
			I took one of the first courses published by Morphocode and found it extremely easy to follow and 
			engaging. The course and my work with SA has inspired me to learn to make interactive maps.
			Hoping to publish it soon!
