		<h1 class="page-title">Flight Buddy</h1>
		<div class="case-study-tagline">A post flight booking experience</div>
		<div class="case-study-date">NOV 2019 - FEB 2020</div>

		<p class="text">Planning and making sure you are ready to board a flight is an anxiety inducing experience for many flight-goers.
			Beginning with what to pack, to the journey to the airport, to the myriad checkpoints within the airport, 
			flight-goers ranging from casual to frequent flyers have several points during their journey where they
			require assistance. This mobile experience addresses those identified needs
			after a person has booked a flight ticket. 
			
		</p>
		<p class="text">I worked on this mobile experience in the capacity of a UX Designer at <a class="inline-links" href="https://www.aertrip.com/">Aertrip</a>, an online travel portal.
		</p>



		<h2 class="heading-two">Inspiration</h2>
		<p class="text"><b class="BookMyShow">BookMyShow</b>, in early 2019, released a feature called the 
			<a class="inline-links" href="https://we-are.bookmyshow.com/introducing-moviemode-7b64ca34c86c">Movie Mode</a> which inspired us to extrapolate a similar experience for flight-goers.
		It seemed to fit right into something like air travel that can be intimidating for a lot of users.
		The experience is designed to 
		guide a user through a set a sequential tasks especially useful in the context of airports.</p>

		<h2 class="heading-two">User Types</h2>

		<p class="text">Opportunities in the user journeys varied primarily based on  
			the <b class="bold">frequency of travel of the user</b>. The other factors that played into the design of the experience
			was whether the user was an international or a domestic traveller and the size of the group travelling or whether it was
			a solo traveller. The approach was to try and design for 
			<a class="inline-links" href="https://www.designkit.org/methods/45">extremes</a> but focus on a first-time flyer
			for this iteration.
		</p>

		<h2 class="heading-two">User Journeys</h2>
		<p class="text">Realising user types and analysing journeys took place somewhat simultaneously in the process.</p>
		<p class="text">The user journey was divided into 7 phases.</p>
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="romap" src="FlightBuddy/phasesJourney.png" alt="7 phases of a journey">
		</div>
		<figcaption class="fig-tit">• 7 phases of the user journey •</figcaption>	
		
		<p class="text">Out of the 7 phases, the last 5 phases were part of the experience to be designed.</p>
		<p class="text">Trello is a list making application that was chosen to brainstorm the user journey. 
			Each list on Trello was assigned a phase of the journey. 
			Each card under a list was populated with a <b class="bold">scenario / expectation</b>.
			</p>
	
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="trello" src="screenshots/trello.png" alt="User Journey on Trello">
		</div>

		<p class="text">
			Each scenario / expectation (in lowercase) was then appended with 
			<b class="bold">opportunities (in uppercase)</b>. 
			</p>
	
		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="trello" src="screenshots/trello1.PNG" alt="User Journey on Trello">
		</div>


		<p class="text">A few rounds of discussions to determine the availability of reliable APIs and feasibility of implementation 
			led us to cut down the final set of cards in the experience to a minimum viable product.</p>

		<h2 class="heading-two">User flow</h2>
	

		<div class="full-width">
			<img class="userFlow" src="FlightBuddy/userFlow.png" alt="User Flow">
		</div>

		<h2 class="heading-two">Style Guide</h2>
		<p class="text">Each card is typically arranged into a heading, a graphic and the relevant description.
			It follows the style guide as in the card below.</p>

		<h2 class="heading-two">Touchpoints</h2>	
		<p class="text">Prateek and his pals are excited about their upcoming holiday and are 
			about to make thier first international trip.
			Prateek has booked a flight from Mumbai to Dubai for him and his four 
			best friends, Allan, Shweta, Anurag and Samantha on the 17th January, 2020 using the Aertrip web app.

			<p class="text-touchpoint1">Flight Buddy is accessible to Prateek on his mobile on the Aertrip app 
				homescreen 24 hours prior to their departure.

			<p class="text-touchpoint2">Flight Buddy is also accessible to Prateek from the booking section on the app 
				after booking.

		<h2 class="heading-two">Introducing Flight Buddy</h2>

		<h2 class="heading-two">Further Scope</h2>

		<p class="text">There are opportunities that can augment the experience apart from what's currently in the pipeline. The
		revamp to air travel post the Coronavirus outbreak, has also opened up quite a few opportunities within the experience.
		</p>
		<ol class="num-list-take" type="1">
			<li class="list-item-takeaway"><b class="bold-miriam">COVID-19 related guidelines and updates :</b>
				At this juncture when guidelines related to travel are constantly changing resulting in a lot of confusion among
				travellers, Flight Buddy can become an effective facilitator for communication of updated protocols related to the 
				user's journey.
			</li>
			<div class="full-width">
				<img class="scope" src="FlightBuddy/arogyaSetu.png" alt="Style Guide">
			</div>	
			<li class="list-item-takeaway-last"><b class="bold-miriam">Empowering power users :</b> Incorporating the "Where's my flight?"
				feature for frequent flyers or flight enthusiasts that gives the status and location of your flight at any time 
				or creating custom packing lists have also emerged as interesting 
				requirements for tech-savvy flight-goers. 
			</li>
			<div class="grid-7">
				<img class="power-user1" src="FlightBuddy/whereFlight.png" alt="Touchpoint 1">
				<img class="power-user2" src="FlightBuddy/packList.png" alt="Touchpoint 2">
			</div>
			<li class="list-item-takeaway"><b class="bold-miriam">Customised experiences for different user types :</b>
				Flight Buddy can evolve to generate custom experiences for users based on the level of 
				handholding they might need. This however can only be facilitated after usability evaluation of the current 
				iteration and developing a method to identify different types of users.
			</li>
			<li class="list-item-takeaway"><b class="bold-miriam">Fostering business partnerships :</b> And finally, there also 
				are opportunities for 
				paid promotions of online streaming applications like Netflix or Amazon Prime and 
				of lounges or stores within airports. 		
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="text">With advancements in the infrastructure and policies surrounding air travel, Flight Buddy is a
			feature that can evolve to educate and be a helping hand to flight-goers.
